Timeline doesn't appear on when search results are homepage because is hardwired to only work on certain pages - see client\src\store\modules\Search.ts

is it possible to add an extra paramter to the api/autocomplete queries to filter them and only show results relevant to maritime?

where do the homepage images come from?
they are all hardwired we can replace them easily enough.



fix filtering (broke during merge)
try to apply filtering to autocomplete searches (if doesn't then work)
put a version on the demo site with the homepage as the landing page for julian to assess
if doesn't work well enough we can change the results page back to the landing pade

I actually changed the "search in x resources" to "search resources" because the count didn't include the filter

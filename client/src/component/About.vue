    <p class="mb-md">The UK Marine Area extends over some 867,400 km<sup>2</sup>, equivalent to 3.5 times the terrestrial
    land surface. The marine and maritime heritage of this vast area is exceptional and diverse.
    It encompasses submerged prehistoric landscapes, inundated monuments and settlements,
    wrecks and aircraft losses, maritime industrial and military complexes, coastal and intertidal
    archaeology, seaside resorts, ports and dockyards, with a proven potential to engage the
    public and address key research themes. The collections which record, locate, characterise
    and represent this abundance are remarkable. They are physical, digital, textual, graphical,
    artefactual, environmental, spatial and oral, but they are split between government
    organisations, commercial concerns, academic institutions, charitable foundations and
    trusts, museums and archives, and individual collectors.</p>

    <p class="mb-md">The <a href="https://unpathdwaters.org.uk/" class="text-blue transition-colors duration-300 hover:text-darkGray hover:underline">Unpath'd Waters</a> project is bringing together this vast array of data according to an
    agreed ontology and mapping to standard vocabularies to increase their interoperability and
    FAIRness. The Unpath'd Waters portal provides one way for users to interrogate our
    national data catalogue, helping them find data and use it for research, maritime heritage
    management, and enjoyment. It provides an exemplar for the <a href="https://www.nationalcollection.org.uk/" class="text-blue transition-colors duration-300 hover:text-darkGray hover:underline">Towards a National Collection</a>
    programme of how the UK's national collection can be made more accessible. The portal is
    built upon technology developed within the framework of the European <a href="https://ariadne-infrastructure.eu/" class="text-blue transition-colors duration-300 hover:text-darkGray hover:underline">ARIADNE</a> research
    infrastructure, and is managed by the <a href="https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/" class="text-blue transition-colors duration-300 hover:text-darkGray hover:underline">Archaeology Data Service</a>.</p>
